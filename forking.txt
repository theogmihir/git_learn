to work with a public repository , do the following

1.fork the repository,make your own version of the repo
	so instead of originaluser\project , we use MihirSaiDudekula\project

2.copy the local repo link 

3.using the command 
	git clone <url>
4.while your local repo is "origin" , the actual repo from where we forked if "upstream"

5.all necessary changes are made in our local repo

6.create a new branch with a name other than master/main and commit changes
	git branch <newname>
	git checkout <newname>
	git add .
	git commit -m "coming from fork"

7.lastly 
	git push origin <newname>

8.now from next time , when you make any changes,dont make it in this branch
  1 branch is for only 1 pull request
  so exit the branch using git checkout
  create a new branch and start making changes (follow same steps)

9.in case while pushing , we are deleting some files/ removing some lines
  we need to push it forcefully
  hence use
  git push -u origin <branchname> -f
