some advanced concepts like combining many commits into one commit
rebading and dealing with merge conflicts

1. lets say on a particular branch we have multiple commits
   if we dont want all these commits and want to deal with a single commit then we can either

   use the reset command to unstage all our commits and then make final commit

   OR

   git rebase -i <commit_code>
