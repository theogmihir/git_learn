some advanced concepts like combining many commits into one commit
rebading and dealing with merge conflicts

1. lets say on a particular branch we have multiple commits
   if we dont want all these commits and want to deal with a single commit then we can either

   use the reset command to unstage all our commits and then make final commit

   OR

   git rebase -i <commit_code>

   all commits above the given code can either be picked or squashed
   use letter p for pick and s for squash

   wherever there is p or pick,it will be kept as a commit
   wherever there is s or squash , it will be merged into previous commit

   after picking and squashing 

   do esc + :x
   and move down to type out a message
